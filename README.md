# There's Been a Murder
Vector Auto Regression analysis of homicides and suicides, 1986-1991, Cape Town, South Africa

Analysis performed as part of a team presentation for Time Series Analysis class, Master's in Big Data and Management, LUISS Business School 2019. 

Data taken from: http://hmms-for-time-series.de/second/data/?C=D;O=D
Dr Leonard Lerer is thanked for making these data available. 

Aim was to use VAR analysis to understand the influence of different types of homicides on other types. In particular I focused on the interplay between Firearms Homicides and Legal Intervention Homicides.
